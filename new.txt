Scenario: You want to create a simple shopping list using JavaScript.

Instructions:

Create three variables using let or const:

item1: Store the name of your first shopping list item (e.g., "Milk").
price1: Store the price of the first item as a number (e.g., 2.50).
numberOfItems: Store the total number of items on your list as a number (initially set to 1).
Optional: Add more items to your list using additional variables like item2, price2, etc., following the same pattern.

Use the console.log function to display the following information on the browser console:

The name and price of the first item (e.g., "Milk: $2.50").
The total number of items on the list (e.g., "Total Items: 1").

Bonus:
Modify the code to allow adding more items dynamically (e.g., using a loop).
Display the total cost of all items on the list.

Tips:
Use comments to explain what your code is doing.
Experiment with different data types (strings, numbers) for your items and prices.
Use arithmetic operators like + and * to calculate the total cost (bonus).

Remember:
Use proper indentation to make your code readable.
Test your code in your browser's developer console.


====================================================================

1. Vowel Counter:

Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) present in the string (case-insensitive).

2. Reverse Words:

Write a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with the order of the words reversed.

3. Palindrome Checker:

Write a function that takes a string as input and returns true if it's a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward), ignoring non-alphanumeric characters, and case-insensitive.

4. Most Frequent Character:

Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the character that appears the most frequently in the string.

5.  Function to calculate the string length without using length, for...of loops, or recursion in JavaScript
