Scenario: You want to create a simple shopping list using JavaScript.

Instructions:

Create three variables using let or const:

item1: Store the name of your first shopping list item (e.g., "Milk").
price1: Store the price of the first item as a number (e.g., 2.50).
numberOfItems: Store the total number of items on your list as a number (initially set to 1).
Optional: Add more items to your list using additional variables like item2, price2, etc., following the same pattern.

Use the console.log function to display the following information on the browser console:

The name and price of the first item (e.g., "Milk: $2.50").
The total number of items on the list (e.g., "Total Items: 1").

Bonus:
Modify the code to allow adding more items dynamically (e.g., using a loop).
Display the total cost of all items on the list.

Tips:
Use comments to explain what your code is doing.
Experiment with different data types (strings, numbers) for your items and prices.
Use arithmetic operators like + and * to calculate the total cost (bonus).

Remember:
Use proper indentation to make your code readable.
Test your code in your browser's developer console.
